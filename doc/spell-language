--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Spell language

* Comments: One-line comments using '#' or '//' as prefix
* names vs. invocations:  spells and anchors have both names
  and invocations.  Names are used to refer to spells and
  anchors from within scripts without revealing their
  invocations.


Each spell specification file consists of a sequence of definitions of
globals, anchors, spells, and procedures.

Types:
------
  These are the primitive types:
  * int
  * string
  * dir	       (a direction: N, S, SE, NW etc.)
  * location   (a single spot in the world)
  * entity     (a PC, NPC, or monster)
  * area       (a set of locations)
  * spell      (a spell)
  * invocation (a spell instance)
  * fail       (a separate type that arises implicitly when a function
    	        fails)

  `fail' arises in special circumstances in some functions, e.g. when
trying to divide by zero, or when function parameters fail to
type-check.  When a fail value flows into an operation, than that
operation is skipped.  When a fail value flows into a function, then
that function evaluates to fail, except for

  * if_then_else (which permits `fail' in its true or false branch)
  * failed (which returns true iff the argument is of type fail).

  We will use standard functional type notation:

  `int * string -> entity' denotes the type of a function that accepts
an integer and a string and returns an entity.  We use the return `()'
for operations (which return nothing).

Globals:
--------
  A `global' is a global variable, declared and defined in the
same line:

	foo = "this is a string";

  Expressions can be arbitrary language expressions.  Note that globals
can only reference the values of globals defined earlier in the same
program.

  There are two special globals:

  * min_casttime : int
    Minimal number of milliseconds of cast delay, no matter what any
    given spell may say.  Cast delay is the time before the next spell
    can be cast.

  * obscure : int
    Chance of a character of a given spell to be obscured (masked out
    by an asterisk).


  Globals can also be defined as CONST (though this should not be done
for the special globals listed above or they will not take effect.)
CONST-defined globals cannot be re-defined.


Expressions:
------------
  Expressions occur in globals, anchors, spells, and procedures.
Expressions evaluate to values of a given type.  Expressions can be
simple literals, area literals, infix expressions, function
applications, or variable refecences.

- Simple literals:
  * 42, 0xff: int literals
  * N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW : dir literals
  * "foo bar" : string literals

- Area literals:
  * @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26)
    This area denotes a single field on a map (new_3-1.gat,
    co-ordinates (26,26).
  * @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26) @+ (10, 10) 
    This area is 100 fields, stretching to a field of size 10x10 to
    the south and east of (26,26) in new_3-1.gat.
  * @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26) towards S (5, 3)
    This area is a rectangular field of depth 3 and width 5 to the
    south of (26,26) in new_3-1.gat.  `depth 3' here means that it
    stretches three fields to the south.  `width 5' here means that it
    extends five fields to the east and five to the west of the
    specified coordinate, for a total width of 11.
    The only directions supported here are S, E, N, W.

- Infix expressions:
  Infix expressions are special functions in which the operator is
  written between two expressions.  Infix expressions largely follow
  the C precedence rules.  The following infix operators are
  supported:
  * addition (+) (operates on ints, concatenates strings, and
    	     	  constructs the union of areas)
  * subtraction (- : int * int -> int)
  * multiplication (* : int * int -> int)
  * division (/ : int * int -> int, may fail)
  * modulo (% : int * int -> int, may fail)
  * comparison (<, >, >=, <=, =, <> : int * int -> int)
    Comparison operators generally work on ints and strings.
    (In)equality checks work on all values except for areas.
    Note that "==" and "!=" are available as alternatives for "=" and
    "<>" (respectively).
  * conjunction and disjunction (&&, || : int * int -> int).  Note
    that these are not short-circuit.
  * Bitwise or (| : int * int -> int)
  * Bitwise and (& : int * int -> int)
  * Bitwise xor (^ : int * int -> int)
  * Shift left and right (<<, >> : int * int -> int)

- Function applications:
  Function applications are written as

    f(arg1, ..., argn)

  where each `argi' is an arbitrary expression.
  For a complete list of Functions, see `functions' below.

- Variable references:
  The expression (foo + 1) references a variable `foo' which must have
  been previously defined.


Anchors:
--------
  Anchors are teleport anchors; spells can look them up by name.  Each
teleport anchor is written as

    TELEPORT-ANCHOR <id> : <invocation-string> = <location>

  For example:

    TELEPORT-ANCHOR tulimshar : "home" = @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26) @+(10, 10) 

  This maps the teleport anchor `tulimshar' to an area in new_3-1.gat
binds it to the name "home".  The function `anchor' can look up
teleport anchors (cf. the function library).


Spells:
-------
  Each spell is written either as

    [spell-modifiers] SPELL <id> : <name> = <spelldef>

  or as

    [spell-modifiers] SPELL <id> (<id> : <sty>) : <name> = <spelldef>

  For example,

    SPELL random_dance : "zxr" = ...

  creates a spell `random_dance' and makes it available under the
invocation "zxr".  The string `...' is not a valid <spelldef>; we will
look at proper spelldefs below.  An alternative example illustrates
the use of parameters:

    SPELL shout (message : STRING) : "zzx" = ...

  This defines a spell `shout' (bound to invocation "zzx") that takes
a parameter `message' of type STRING.  Valid types are STRING and PC:
PC parameters are automatically translated into a player character
entity of that name, or mapped to the caster if the specified name
does not map to a player character or is missing.

  The list of spell modifiers is short:

  * SILENT means that the spell's invocation will never be broadcast,
    	   not even obscured.
  * LOCAL means that the spell is bound to the location it was cast at
    	  and will not `travel' with the caster.
  * NONMAGIC means that the spell is not affected by the caster's ability
          to perform magic.  Typically used for special (quest) keywords.

  Modifiers may be given in any order, but only once.

- Spell bodies

  Spell bodies consist of three parts: LET bindings, spell guards and
  effects.  LET bindings locally bind names to values.  Spell guards
  are constraints that must be satisfied for the spell to be
  triggered.  Effects describes what happens if the spell is
  successfully triggered.  Spells may have multiple guards and
  effects.

  Consider the following example:

    SPELL plugh (message : STRING) : "zzx" =
          LET x = "kappa"
              y = "sigma"
          IN
          (MANA 1, CATALYSTS ["Pearl"]) => EFFECT message (caster, "First branch");
        | (MANA 20) => EFFECT message (caster, "Second branch")

  This defines a spell `plugh' with two let bindings (`x' bound to
  "kappa" and `y' bound to "sigma") and two `branches' which are
  tested in sequence.  The first branch tests whether the caster has
  one spellpoint and owns a pearl-- if so, the effect of sending a
  message "First branch" to the caster is triggered.

  However, if the spell guard is not satisfied, the magic engine
  examines the second branch.  Now, if the caster has 20 spellpoints,
  we INSTEAD trigger the effect of sending the message "Second branch"
  to the caster.

- Spell guards

  Spell guards can be omitted; in that case, just use the effect
  itself.  Otherwise they can be any of the following:
  * MANA x:  Require x spellpoints to be present.  If this spellguard
    is taken, x mana will be consumed implicitly.  This requirement is
    cumulative.
  * CASTTIME x:  Require that the caster spend x milliseconds until
    the next spell can be cast.  This requirement is cumulative.  If
    the total casttime for a spell is less than the global variable
    min_casttime, then the latter supercedes the specified spell cast
    delay.
  * REQUIRE <expr>:  Test that the specified expression evaluates to
    nonzero and does not fail.  Requirements are cumulative.
  * CATALYSTS <items>: Ensure that the caster possesses all specified
    items.  This effect is cumulative.
  * COMPONENTS <items>: Ensure that the caster possesses all specified
    items.  If the branch suceeeds, all items specified here are
    consumed.  This effect is cumulative.

  Items can be specified as follows:
  * [ 700, 701 ]	-- require one item of item ID 700 and one of 701.
  * [ 700, 3 * 701 ]	-- require 1 item of item ID 700 and 3 of 701.
  * [ "Pearl" ]		-- require one item named `Pearl' in the item DB.

  Spell guards can be combined as follows:
  * `or': disjunction.  The first matching path is taken.
  * (a, ..., n): conjunction.  a, n, and everything in between must be
    satisfied.
  * a => b:  Implication.  If `a' is satisfied, try to satisfy `b'.
    This operation is useful to combine different branches (see
    below.)

  Different branches of spell effects are separated by the vertical
  bar `|'.  For example,

    SPELL plugh (message : STRING) : "zzx" =
        MANA 5 => (  (CATALYSTS ["Pearl"]) =>
                            EFFECT message (caster, "First branch");
                   | (MANA 20) =>
                            EFFECT message (caster, "Second branch");)

  will always try to deduct 5 Mana points but then make a choice of
  whether to go to the first branch (if the player has `Pearl') or to
  the second (if the player does not have `Pear' but has another 20
  spell points, for a total of 25 spell points, all of which will be
  consumed in that case.)


- Effects

  Effects describe what happens when a spell is triggered.  Each
  spell has at least one EFFECT specification, which looks as follows:

    EFFECT <effectlist> [ ATTRIGGER <effectlist> ] [ ATEND <effectlist> ]

  The three parts are as follows:
  * EFFECT:  All effects here are executed as soon as the spell is
    triggered.
  * ATEND:  All steps described here are executed when the spell
    finishes.   Note that the spell may remain active after all steps
    from the EFFECT section have been taken; this happens when the spell
    triggers a status change (using the `status_change' operation,
    as described in the operations library).  In that case the spell
    will terminate only after all status changes have finished.
    The ATEND section is not called when the spell finishes due to the
    caster dying.
  * ATTRIGGER:  This section is used only for the `override_attack'
    operation and described there.

  Before effects are executed, the engine defines the following
  variables:

  * The parameter (if any)
  * caster : entity (the caster of this spell)
  * spellpower : int (the caster's spellpower, normally 6 -- 198)
  * location : location (the location the spell is currently at)
  * self_spell : spell (the current spell)
  * self_invocation : invocation (the current spell instance)

  The engine can then execute the following effects from the effect list:
  * SKIP;	    #  a no-op
  * ABORT;	    #  Abort the spell, don't run ATEND, don't consume a
    		    #    trigger charge (cf. `override_attack')
  * END;	    #  Skip to the ATEND block
  * WAIT <expr>;    #  Wait <expr> milliseconds before continuing
  * <id> = <expr>;  #  Set <id> to the result of evaluating <expr>
  * (<s1> ... <sn>) #  Execute statements <s1> through <sn> in sequence
  * IF <c>	    #  Test condition <c>.  If nonzero,
    THEN <s1>	    #    execute <s1>.  Otherwise,
    ELSE <s2> 	    #    execute <s2>.
                    #    The `ELSE' branch can be omitted.

  * FOREACH <k> <id> IN <expr> DO <s>
                    # Evaluate <expr> to an area, find all entities in
		    #   the area that match <k>, randomise this list,
		    #   bind <id> to each in turn and execute <s>.

    Example:

    FOREACH ENTITY t IN rbox(location(caster), 20)
      DO aggravate(t, 0, caster);
      	 	    # This aggravates all entities within 20 paces of
		    #   the caster to attack the caster.

    Valid values for <k> are
    + ENTITY : PC or mob
    + PC
    + MOB
    + TARGET : mob, PC (but only if we are on a PvP map)

  * FOR <id> = <start> TO <stop> DO <stmt>
    # This will iterate from <start> to <stop> (inclusively), bind
    # <id> to the current iteration value, and execute <stmt>.

  * BREAK;
    # This will break out of the current FOR loop, FOREACH loop, or
    # procedure.

  * <id> ( <expr1>,  ..., <exprn> );
    # This executes an operation.  See `Operations', below, for a
    # list.

  * CALL <id> ( <expr1>,  ..., <exprn> );
    # This will execute a procedure, after binding the actual
    # parameters from <expr1> to <exprn> to the formal procedure
    # parameters.

  * { ... }
    # This executes arbitrary eAthena script code.  The following
    # variables script variables are bound implicitly:
    # - @caster_name$ is the name of the spellcaster
    # - @caster and @target are also bound, to useless values (sorry.)
    #
    # By default, script popup boxes are sent to the caster.  This can
    # be overridden by setting the special `script_target' variable.

Procedures:
-----------
  Procedures are defined as

    PROCEDURE <id> ( <id>, ... , <id> ) = <effectlist>

  For example,

    PROCEDURE testproc(x) = message(caster, "foo(" + x + )");
                            y = 10;
                            x = 20;

  defines a procedure `testproc' with one formal parameter `x'.
  Procedure execution is nonrecursive and uses dynamic scoping.  The
  latter means that it can modify variables in the caller's scope.  In
  the above example, the assignment to `y' will be visible to the
  caller.  The assignment to `x' however will be not be visible, since
  that assignment goes to the parameter and is therefore limited in
  scope to `testproc'.  More precisely,

      EFFECT x = 0; y = 0; testproc(1);
      	     message(caster, "x=" + x + ", y=" + y);

  would print

      foo(1)
      x=0, y=10

  (note how the update to x is isolated from the caller.)

    the string `b' as a substring.

  + strstr : string * string -> bool
    strstr(a, b) returns the offset of the first instance of the
    string `b' in the string `a', or fails if there is none.  The
    offset is reported with a base of zero, i.e., strstr("xyz", "x") = 0.

    Compute the length of a string, in characters.

  + substr : string * int * int -> string
    substr(s, offset, len) extracts a substring of the length `len' at
    offset `offset'.  The substring is automatically clipped, i.e., the
    function will never fail.

  + sqrt : int -> int
    Computes the square root of the specified number

  + map_level : location -> int
    Determines the map level: 0 for outside, 1 for inside, 2ff for
    dungeon levels (going down)

    Determines whether the specified entity is no longer alive.

  + extract_healer_experience : entity * int -> int
    Extracts `healer experience points' from the specified entity.
    Non-PCs always have an empty pool of healer exprerience points.
    PCs gain such experience points by killing/completing quests,
    though this `healer experience point pool' slowly drains itself.
    extract_healer_experience(pc, xp) extracts up to `xp' points.

  + is_pc : entity -> bool
    Determines whether the target is a player character

Operations:
-----------
This section documents the operations API.

  + sfx : entity * int * int -> ()
        | location * int *int -> ()
    Trigger a special effect (specified by sfx ID) for an entity or a
    location.  The int specifies a delay until the effect is issued.

  + itemheal : entity * int * int -> ()
    itemheal(entity, hp, sp) triggers item healing.  This will
    hopefully be slowed down if an appropriate server patch is
    installed.

  + instaheal : entity * int * int -> ()
    itemheal(entity, hp, sp) heals instantly.

  + shroud : entity * int -> ()
    shroud(entity, flags) hides the entity's name (only for PCs).
    Flags:  0x01: Hide PC'ss name when talking
            0x02: Shroud vanishes when player picks something up
            0x04: Shroud vanishes when player talks
    The shroud will not affect players in visible range until the
    entity has left and re-entered their field of vision.  This can be
    enforced by warping.

  + unshroud : entity -> ()
    Counter a shroud.

  + message : entity * string -> ()
    Send a message to the entity.

  + messenger_npc : location * int
                    * string * string * int -> ()
    messenger_npc(location, image, npc_name, message, duration)
    creates a messenger NPC looking like the `image' at `location',
    with name `npc_name' and delivering the `message' when clicked
    upon.  The NPC disappears after the `duration' in ms has expired.

  + move : entity * dir -> ()
    Move the entity into the specified direction, unless that
    direction is blocked.

  + warp : entity * location -> ()
    Warp entity to specified location.

  + spawn : area * entity * int * int * int * int -> ()
    spawn(area, owner, mob_id, attitude, count, lifetime) spawns for a
    limited `lifetime' (in ms) a total of `count' monsters of kind
    `mob_id' in `area'.  `attitude' specifies how they behave:
      0 : attack everyone
      1 : be friendly
      2 : attack enemies of `owner' and give XP to `owner' if successful

  + banish : entity -> ()
    If the entity was spawned by the `spawn' operation, eliminate it.


  + status_change : entity * int * int
                    * int * int * int * int -> ()
    status_change(entity, status, v1, v2, v3, v4, duration) initiates
    a status change.  The precise status change (and the meaning of
    `v1', `v2', `v3', `v4') varies depending on `status'.  This
    operation may delay spell termination (and the ATEND effect).
    ATEND can therefore be used to notify the caster that the status
    change has finished.

  + stop_status_change : entity * int
    Stops a status change

  + override_attack : entity * int * int
                             * int * int *int * int -> ()
    override_attack(entity, charges, delay, range, icon, animation, stop)
    overrides the entity's current attack (only for PCs).  The entity
    will have `charges' attacks that instead result in calling the
    ATTRIGGER effect for this spell.  When this operation is called,
    the spell environment (variables etc.) is cloned into a separate
    invocation.  This special invocation will be triggered every time
    the entity tries to attack, until they have run out of charages (at
    which time the previous behaviour is restored.)
    `delay' specifies the attack delay.
    `range' specifies the attack range as shown in the client GUI.
    `icon' is the ID of a status-effect ID that will be displayed
    while the spell is in effect.
    `animation' is the attack animation ID that should be used.
    `stop' decides whether attacking should stop once the spell is out
    of charges (1) or continue (0). (Note: this doesn't properly work,
    possibly due to client issues.  Always use 0.)

    Note that if the ATTRIGGER effect ABORTs, no charge will be
    consumed.

    ATTRIGGER can refernece the player's target via the `target'
    variable.

    Example:

    SPELL tshuffle : "zvp" =
        (MANA 1, CATALYSTS ["Pearl"]) =>
        EFFECT
                override_attack(caster, 3, 500, 10, 700, 31);
        ATTRIGGER
                IF (not (line_of_sight(location, location(target))))
                THEN (message (caster, "No line of sight!"); ABORT;)
                FOR i = 0 TO 10 DO (move(target, random_dir(0)););

    This overrides the caster's attack for three attacks (attack delay
    500, range 10) to instead randomly move around any entity that the
    player tries to attack by up to 11 paces.

  + create_item : entity * int * int -> ()
                | entity * string * int -> ()
    create_item(entity, item, count) gives the `entity' `count'
    instances of `item'.  As usual, `item' can be either a string name
    or an item ID.

  + aggravate : entity * int * entity -> ()
    aggravate (victim, mode, target) causes the `victim' to
      mode = 0: attack `target'
      mode = 1: become universally permanently aggressive
      mode = 2: both of the above

  + injure : entity * entity * int * int -> ()
    injure(attacker, defender, hp, sp) causes damage to the defender
    from the attacker (possibly killing, giving XP etc.), unless the
    defender is immortal (NPC) or a PC on a non-PvP map.

  + emote : entity * int -> ()
    Issues the specified emotion to the specified entity.

  + set_script_variable : entity * string * int -> ()
    Sets a script variable to the specified value

  + set_hair_colour : entity * int -> ()
    Sets the hair colour of the specified entity to the specified
    value (must be a PC).

  + set_hair_style : entity * int -> ()
    Adjusts the hair style of a PC.

  + drop_item : location * (int | string) * int * int -> ()
    drop_item(place, "name", count, duration) drops `count' items
    (where count may be zero) of name "name" at `place'.  The items
    vanish again after `duration'.

  + drop_item_for : location * (int | string)
                    * int * int * entity * int -> ()
    drop_item_for(place, obj, count, duration, owner, delay) works
    like drop_item(place, obj, count, duration), except that the item
    can only be picked up by `owner' for the next `delay'
    milliseconds, modulo pickup rules (spousal pickup, out-of-range).

  + gain_experience : entity * int * int * int -> ()
    gain_experience(player, base_xp, job_xp, reason) gives expereince
    points to `player'.  If reason is 0, they are handed out normally,
    but if reason is 1, then those experience points are NOT added to
    the pool of experience points that healers can draw from `player'.


Script API updates:
-------------------
Two new script API functions are available:

  * getspellinvocation : string -> string
    Looks up a spell by spell ID and returns the spell's invocation.
  * getanchorinvocation : string -> string
    Looks up a teleport anchor by anchor ID and returns the invocation.

  GLOBAL ::= 'CONST'? <id> '=' (EXPR) ';'

  Available globals:

* teleport-anchor

  ANCHOR ::= 'TELEPORT-ANCHOR' <id> ':' (INVOCATION) '=' (EXPR)

  For example,

    TELEPORT-ANCHOR t : "tulimshar" = @("map_3-1.gat", 44, 70)

  creates a teleport anchor with name `t' and invocation `tulimshar' at the speicfied location.

* spell

  SPELL ::= spellmod 'SPELL' <id> (ARG)? ':' (INVOCATION) '=' (SPELLDEF)

  SPELLMOD ::= ('SILENT' | 'LOCAL')*

  (silent:  invocation silently dropped.  local:  `location' variable doesn't change after spell init.)

  ARGTYPE ::= 'PC'	(* yields a pc, or self *)
	    | 'STRING'

  (* `ATTRIGGER' is executed as a separate effect if the spell is `triggered'.  If the trigger has a target, it is denoted
   * in the variable `target'.
   * `ATEND' is invoked for normal termination, i.e., after the spell is over or has been dispelled.  `ATEND' is NOT used
   * for the triggered effect; instead, spawn a separate spell in ATTRIGGER if that is desired. *)

  DECL ::= <id> '=' (EXPR) ';'
